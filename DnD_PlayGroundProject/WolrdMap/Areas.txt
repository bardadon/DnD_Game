| :---- | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | **The Whispering Woods**    | A dense forest filled with ancient trees that murmur forgotten secrets. Wolves and fey creatures roam its mossy paths.  |
| 1     | **Ashen Peaks**             | Jagged volcanic mountains with treacherous trails and fire-born creatures. Rumors speak of a dragon’s lair deep within. |
| 2     | **Stormvale Plains**        | Vast open grasslands where tempests rage unpredictably. Nomads, centaurs, and sky serpents inhabit the endless horizon. |
| 3     | **The Sunken Marshes**      | A fetid swamp of decay and mist. Undead wander aimlessly through drowned ruins of a long-forgotten civilization.        |
| 4     | **Frostmarch Tundra**       | A frozen expanse where survival is a battle against cold and beast alike. Home to frost giants and lost relics.         |
| 5     | **Ebon Hollow**             | A cursed valley where the sun never rises. Shadows twist and flicker as if alive. Only the brave or the damned enter.   |

| 7     | **Crystal Caverns**         | A glittering maze of luminescent minerals and subterranean rivers. The echoes of singing stones haunt intruders.        |
| 8     | **Verdant Hollow**          | A hidden jungle valley bursting with life — and danger. Ancient temples overrun by nature conceal forbidden magic.      |
| 9     | **The Obsidian Desert**     | A barren wasteland of black glass and shifting dunes. Rumor has it a fallen star slumbers beneath its surface.          |
| 10    | **Isle of the Fallen Star** | A mysterious island surrounded by perpetual storms. Arcane energy radiates from the crater at its heart.                |



Note1:
Every Area can be classified as: Forest, High Mountain, Desert, Volcanic etc...

Based on that classification, I can generate common themes for them. For example The Whispering Woods is a lvl 1-5 area of type Forest
This means that monsters are wolves, giant spiders, treants, bandits etc.... of lvl 1-5, they will drop herbs and ingredients etc...


Whenever there's an encounter, I will throw a d20 to check which monster it is according to the table below

Also, each zone will have its own modifiers. A Forest will have +2 Stealth for example.

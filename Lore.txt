🌌 World Name: Eryndor
1. World History
The Age of Creation

Eryndor was forged by the primordial deities known as the Seven Shapers, each representing a force of nature: Flame, Frost, Storm, Stone, Life, Shadow, and Spirit.

These Shapers created the continents, seas, and magical ley lines that power the world.

Mortal civilizations rose along the ley lines, drawing magic from these ancient veins.


The Age of Heroes

Legendary figures arose: kings, sorcerers, and warrior-champions who shaped nations.

The Great Sundering, a cataclysm caused by misuse of forbidden magic, split continents and cursed the Shadowlands.

Many ruins scattered across Eryndor are remnants of this heroic age.




The Age of Strife

Nations vied for control over magic-rich territories.

Dragons, giants, and elemental beings became both protectors and threats.

The Emberlight Citadel fell, leaving a scar of ash and fire.

The Shadowlands spread from the north, corrupting the land.



The Current Era (The Twilight of Magic)

Magic is waning in some regions and unpredictable in others.

New threats rise: necromantic cults, sea-born monsters, and the return of ancient beasts.

Adventurers are called to restore balance, discover lost artifacts, and explore forgotten lands.




2. Current World Status

Eryndor is fragmented: kingdoms, city-states, wilderness, and cursed lands coexist uneasily.

Magic is unreliable in many areas; ley lines are unstable.

Trade and travel are dangerous due to roaming monsters and bandit clans.

Heroes are in high demand: kingdoms hire adventurers to explore ruins, secure towns, or investigate magical anomalies.

Ancient prophecy whispers of the “Reawakening of the Seven,” a coming event that could either save or destroy the world.

Dynamic Relationships

NPCs and factions react to player actions:

Killing Shadow Cult minions increases Emberlight Council favor.

Destroying forest landmarks angers Verdant Circle.

Sea-based missions influence Seaborn Guild’s trading power.

Factions can have conflicts that spawn events:

Shadow Cult raids a village → triggers Emberlight Council retaliation → affects nearby map areas.

NPCs move on the map based on daily/weekly cycles or major events:

Lyra Windstrider moves between forest areas to check ley lines.

Thorn Ironfist travels to ruins or mountain passes seeking artifacts.

Captain Selene patrols coasts; may appear in unexpected ports.

Key Notes on Using This Table

NPCs move based on time/events — e.g., Lyra might patrol multiple forest areas.

Dynamic events can trigger random encounters or quests, e.g.:

Emberlight Citadel may spawn fire spirits at night.

Shadowlands may spawn wraith patrols randomly.

Danger Level guides encounter tables:

1–2: Mostly wildlife / minor hazards

3: Mixed creatures, occasional hazards

4: Strong monsters + environmental hazards

5: Boss-level encounters / high event frequency

Special loot/resources can be generated when the player explores the area fully.
